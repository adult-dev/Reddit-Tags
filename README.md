# What it does
This project aims to enable the user to add tags to subreddits. This way you can retrieve subreddits you are interested in.
You can search for your saved subreddit by tags, use "+" to search mutliple tags(example: coding+scripting). 
This returns all subreddits that have these tags. You can then copy this text and use it on sites like "redditp".
