# What it does
This project aims to enable the user to add tags to subreddits. This way you can retrieve subreddits you are interested in.
You can search for your saved subreddit by tags, use "+" to search mutliple tags(example: coding+scripting). 
This returns all subreddits that have these tags. You can then copy this text and use it on sites like "redditp".

# Browsers
Tested only on Chrome, should also work on other Chrome based browsers.
Probably works on Firefox too since I'm not using any chrome specific code.

# Things to Maybe Add
- [ ] Autosuggest tags that are in the DB.
  - [ ] Make it like adding tags instead of adding "+" at each tag.   
- [ ] Project looks poopie make it look less poopie.
