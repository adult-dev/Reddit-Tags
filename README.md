# What it does
This project aims to enable the user to add tags to subreddits. This way you can retrieve subreddits you are interested in and multiview them with sites like redditp, scrolller etc.
Press the "add tag" button(might need to refresh page). Enter the tag you want to add and press enter, you can add multiple tags.
Press the "search tags" button. Enter the tags you want, like with the adding of tag, write the tag and press enter. You can enter multiple tags.
Show the results with a button to copy the generated subreddits example coding+scripting
This returns all subreddits that have these tags. You can then copy this text and use it on sites like "redditp".

# Browsers
Tested only on Chrome, should also work on other Chrome based browsers.
Probably works on Firefox too since I'm not using any chrome specific code.

# Things to Maybe Add
- [x] Autosuggest tags that are in the DB.
  - [x] Make it like adding tags instead of adding "+" at each tag.   
- [ ] Project looks poopie make it look less poopie.
